## Session Template Brainstorm

I want to be able to set up session templates, in particular 5 templates with the following names:

- Pull
- Push
- Legs
- Upper
- Lower

so that when I click 'New Session' button on the @components/Dashboard.jsx page, I can pick from either of these templates, or just a blank one.
I also want the templates to either be a: pre-filled with the weights and reps from the last time that similar session was complete so that I know what to do during this instance, or b: have the placeholders for the weight and reps set to the previous value that was used before, whatever makes the most sense

I also want to be able to create a new template and edit the template if needed

I also want to be able to swap out exercises when I am working out if something isn't available, and it won't affect the template, but maybe next time I go to complete that session, there is some sort of indication that I swapped out an exercise for something else the last time, and give the sets and reps etc for the swapped in exercise, plus the data from the swapped out exercise the last time I complete it (if available)
