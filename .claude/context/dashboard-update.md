## Dashboard Update

I want to update the dashboard, the section that handles displaying the workouts.
The currrent display means that as more are added, the page will get very long, the updates I want to make are:

The card that displays the workout is collapsible, so that it just says 'Push', and then when I tap on it, it expands and I can see each exercise in the workout
I also would like them to be grouped under a header like 'July' so that they are grouped together by month, maybe these are under another header that says the year also?

I just want to make the appearance more sleek and less noisy
